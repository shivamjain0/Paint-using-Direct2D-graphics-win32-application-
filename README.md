Utilized Win32 API and Direct2D for drawing and painting.
(.exe file is their also, you can check and use this application )

Implemented resizable shapes and a resizable user interface.

Handled both mouse and keyboard interactions for drawing operations.

Also has context menu to cut, copy or paste the shapes.

Shapes and mouse would not go out of the screen on resizing.
